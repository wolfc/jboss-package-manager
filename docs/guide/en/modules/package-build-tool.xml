    <title>Package Build tool</title>
    <para>
        As we have seen so far, an package is nothing more than a .jar/.zip file. Expect for the presence of the
        package.xml in the package, the JBoss Package Manager does not add any other requirements/restrictions on
        the package format or contents. As such, i personally, don't see any need for an new build tool which allows
        to create the packages. Already existing tools (there are lots) like Ant build script or anything else
        can always be used to create these packages.
    </para>
    <para>
        But, if at some point of time, the requirement for such a build tool arises, then we will update this section
        with the details.
