        <title>What's the current state of JBoss Package Manager?</title>
        <para>
            There's still lots to be done in the JBoss Package Manager. The current state of JBoss Package Manager
            has the very basic implementation of installing a package. It's currently in a PoC state and more
            functionality is being worked on.
        </para>
        <para>
            Some of features/functionalities that need to be thought about, but not limited to, are:

                        A simple database management which allows for maintaining/tracking installed package information

        <title>Enough of these docs, i need some action!</title>
        <para>
            In the next few days, i'll add a simple script which can be used to run the package manager. But right now,
            you can try out the org.jboss.ejb3.packagemanager.impl.DefaultPackageManagerImpl.main(Stringp[] args)
            method by passing it the appropriate arguments, listed in the previous sections.
        </para>
        <para>
            You can also have a look at the org.jboss.ejb3.packagemanager.test.install.unit.BasicInstallTestCase to
            see how the install works. That test case has been written with many comments to make sure that each step
            is explained clearly. It covers almost all of the currently implemented functionality in the JBoss Package
            Manager, including HTTP URL support. You can add your own tests there to try out the JBoss Package Manager.
            To run the tests, use the following Maven command on the package-manager project root:
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
mvn clean test
]]>
            </programlisting>
            
        </para>
