<chapter id="transaction">
    <title>Transactional Support</title>
    <para>
        The package manager has been implemented to support transactions during its installation, upgrade or un-installation
        process. So if something goes wrong in the middle of an upgrade, then the entire operation is rolled back to the
        state before the upgrade process was triggered. Same is the case with installation and un-installation.
