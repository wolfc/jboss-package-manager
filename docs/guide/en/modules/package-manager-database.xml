    <title>Package Manager Database</title>
    <para>
        In order to keep track of the packages that have been installed in the system (i.e. JBoss Application Server), the
        package manager maintains a database.
    </para>
    <para>
        This section provides a brief overview of the implementation details about the package manager database. Normal
        users of the package manager may skip this section. But if you are interested in knowing some of the implementation
        details, then read on!
    </para>
    <sect2>
        <title>Database server</title>
        <para>
            The default implementation of the package manager uses Derby Embedded database. Derby Embedded database allows
            for the database to created and managed from within another Java application. One of the goals of the package manager
            is to reduce the additional software installations, for using the package manager. Derby fits in, because it
            does not require the DB server to be installed or started externally.
            <note>
                <para>
                    At this point, there's no way to configure a different DB server to be used with the JBoss Package Manager.
                    There are no immediate plans to allow this either. But if in future, this feature is required, then
                    it should be easy enough to provide it.
                </para>
            </note>
        </para>
        <para>
            Furthermore, the package manager implementation uses JPA (Java Persistence API) for it's interaction with the
            database.
