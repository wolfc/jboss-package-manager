    <title>Package Manager Installation</title>
    <para>
        To use or build the package manager, you need Java 6.
    </para>
    <para>
        The package manager can be currently built from
        <ulink url="http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbossas/projects/ejb3/trunk/package-manager/">SVN</ulink>.
        However at a later stage it will be made available to be downloaded from jboss.org download site. To build from SVN,
        you need a Maven 2.0.9 or higher and JDK 6. The command to build the package manager is as follows:
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
[jpai@jaikiran package-manager]$ mvn clean package
     ]]>
        </programlisting>
        This command creates the package manager in .zip format as well as .tar.gz format. These files will be available
        under package-manager/target folder. To install the package manager, extract the .zip (or .tar.gz) to a folder of
        your choice and then run the setup script available in the bin folder. For more details about the setup script,
        take a look at <xref linkend="package-manager-setup">this section</xref>
